command

all keys here are assumed to be saved to the keystack unless one of the
following tags are used:

APPLY
    This is the default for any key that is mentioned here.
    The key will be fed to the viewscreen immediately, and it will
    be stored on the stack for future frames as well.
    
    Good for a key like entering a submenu or scrolling around
    
    (Some scrolling, such as scrolling around on the map,
    is hardcoded and stored as an X/Y/Z coordinate rather
    than being applied as a keyqueue entry; in such a case,
    it'd be bad to also APPLY it here.)
    
APPLY_NO_SAVE
    Feeds the key but does not save it to the stack.
    
    Good for a key which e.g. toggles a flag.

SKIP
    Keys which are not mentioned are assumed to have the SKIP tag by default.
    The SKIP tag means that the focus string (FS) and DEPTH will be checked
    after applying, and if a change occurs, the key will be added
    to the stack automatically, or cause a stack rewind (e.g. LEAVESCREEN)
    
IGNORE
    These keys are not applied nor saved to the stack.
    
    Good for anything which causes bugs and we don't want to have to deal
    with.

here are actions which we can safely apply and don't affect
the viewscreen/keystack at all, they can all go here.

[KEY:DESTROYBUILDING:SUSPENDBUILDING]
    [APPLY_NO_SAVE]
    
these are ignored
[KEY:D_ONESTEP]
    [IGNORE] can't handle onestepping yet
[KEY:UNITVIEW_FOLLOW:D_LOOK_FOLLOW]
    [IGNORE] can't handle following yet
        
viewscreen-specific actions
[VS:dwarfmode]
    [SUBSCREEN:Default]

        these require switching to a submenu immediately upon entering,
        because the submenu is normally remembered by DF but plexing
        causes that to be meaningless
        
        [KEY:D_STOCKPILES]
            [NOCHECK] don't check where we end up, like we normally would.
            [POSTKEY_LOAD_STOCKPILE]
        [KEY:D_DESIGNATE]
            [NOCHECK]
            [POSTKEY_LOAD_DESIGNATE]
            
        these all need a consistent cursor position
        
        [KEY:D_VIEWUNIT:D_LOOK:D_BUILDITEM:D_CIVZONE]
            [NO_SIDEBAR_REFRESH]
            [POST_RESTORE_CURSOR]
            
    [SUBSCREEN:Squads]
    
        nothing here yet. :(
    
    [SUBSCREEN:Build]
        [FS:dwarfmode/Build/Material/Groups]
            [KEY:SELECT]
            
                (if we don't end up here, let's forget about the SELECT key.)
                
                [CHECKFS:dwarfmode/Build/Material/Groups]
            
        [FS:dwarmode/Build/Position*]
            [KEY:SELECT]
        
                (if we don't end up here, let's forget about the SELECT key.)
            
                [CHECKFS:dwarfmode/Build/Material/Groups]
