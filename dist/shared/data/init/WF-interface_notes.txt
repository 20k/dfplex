A number of keys are untriggerable from the webfortress side of things, a
natural consequence of the client running in a web browser. Many of these are
best fixed natively, in dwarf fortress, for onscreen prompts and such.
A quick list, that should eventually be automated:

F1-F12 aren't reliably triggered by browsers. If possible, use Ctrl-[1 to +] instead.
for example:
[SYM:0:F1] -> [SYM:2:1]
[SYM:0:F11] -> [SYM:2:Minus]

[KEY: ] is not triggered by the webfort plugin, but [SYM:0:Space] works.

[KEY:<] and [KEY:>] seems to break when somebody uses a non-US keyboad through
webfort. Possibly symptomatic of a lot of locale issues that nobody notices
because of how egregious this one is.
