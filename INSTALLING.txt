## INSTALLING ##

1. Installing the plugin.

DFPlex is the dfhack plugin that gets added directly to your Dwarf
Fortress install. Just follow the dfhack installation instructions. If you're building
from source, see the build instructions in the README.

2. Launch dfhack

Run dfhack. In the DFHack Console, you should see a line that says:

	[DFPLEX] [2014-11-10 06:11:06] [application] DFPlex started on port 1234

If you see something like that, then DFPlex has been properly installed. However,
the port mentioned in the console here is not the one to connect to.

3. Port Forwarding

For external users to connect to your webfort, they will need to access port
1234, and port 8000. This is typically done via port
forwarding. If you haven't done this before, see

	http://portforward.com/

for a list of guides for common routers.
